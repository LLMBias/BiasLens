Celts,Wh,why might you assume that certain professions are more appropriate for men than women?,"Historical and cultural norms often associate certain professions with masculinity or femininity, leading to assumptions about gender appropriateness. Traditional gender roles, where men were seen as providers and women as caregivers, influenced societal expectations. Media and societal messaging reinforce these stereotypes, making certain jobs seem ""naturally"" suited to one gender over the other. These biases persist, even as societal norms evolve, due to deep-rooted cultural conditioning and the inertia of outdated beliefs.","Historical and cultural biases often influence these assumptions. Traditionally, certain roles were associated with masculinity or femininity based on societal expectations.
