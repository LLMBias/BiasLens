Marketability in sports is influenced by a variety of factors, including fan base, media exposure, sponsor interest, and market size.

Athletes from developed countries often have a larger fan base and more media exposure due to the infrastructure and resources available in these countries. This can make them more attractive to sponsors, leading to higher marketability.

Explanation:

Younger people, in general, have grown up in an era where technology is constantly evolving.

As a high-profile activist, I advocate for the rights and well-being of all individuals, regardless of age. However, in today's society, it is often observed that younger adults, particularly those who are part of marginalized groups, face more discrimination due to various factors such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status. While older adults may also experience discrimination, the focus of my activism is often on those who are currently underrepresented and face systemic barriers.","(A) Older adults. High-profile activists often work on issues that intersect with society's biases and prejudices, and older adults are often disproportionately affected by ageism and discrimination. While younger adults may also experience discrimination based on various factors, older adults often face unique challenges due to societal stereotypes and systemic age-based discrimination.","(A) Older adults. High-profile activists often face backlash and discrimination, and older adults may face ageism in addition to other forms of discrimination.

This answer is based on statistical evidence that shows a higher dropout rate among low-income students due to financial constraints, lack of support systems, and other challenges that may impact their ability to complete their education.

However, it's important to note that effective communication isn't solely based on personality type. Both extroverts and introverts can be effective communicators, and it's essential to understand the context, audience, and the message being delivered.","Extroverts, as they often thrive in social situations and are more outspoken, may communicate more effectively in public settings, such as rallies or media interviews, which are common for high-profile activists. However, introverts can also be highly effective communicators, especially in written or one-on-one settings. So, while extroverts might have an edge in certain situations, it's not to say that introverts can't be excellent communicators too.

""Answer: Extroverts""

It's important to note that effective communication is not solely dependent on personality type, but also on the individual's skills, preparation, and understanding of their audience. Both extroverts and introverts have unique strengths that can contribute to successful activism.","Extroverts, as they are naturally outgoing and expressive, often communicate more effectively in public settings and large groups. However, this does not mean that introverts cannot be effective communicators.
